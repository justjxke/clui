# CLUI — Command Line User Interface for Codex

A lightweight, transparent desktop overlay for Codex on macOS. CLUI wraps the Codex CLI/app-server in a floating pill interface with multi-tab sessions, a permission approval UI, voice input, and a skills marketplace.

![CLUI](/Users/jake/Documents/Projects/clui/docs/hero.png)


## Features

- **Floating overlay** — transparent, click-through window that stays on top. Toggle with `⌥ + Space` (fallback: `Cmd+Shift+K`).
- **Multi-tab sessions** — each tab opens its own Codex session with independent session state.
- **Permission approval UI** — intercepts tool calls via PreToolUse HTTP hooks so you can review and approve/deny from the UI.
- **Conversation history** — browse and resume past Codex threads.
- **Skills marketplace** — browse Codex-native skills, plugins, and apps without leaving CLUI.
- **Voice input** — local speech-to-text via Whisper (required, installed automatically).
- **File & screenshot attachments** — paste images or attach files directly.
- **Dual theme** — dark/light mode with system-follow option.

## Why CLUI

- **Codex, but visual** — keep CLI power while getting a fast desktop UX for approvals, history, and multitasking.
- **Human-in-the-loop safety** — tool calls are reviewed and approved in-app before execution.
- **Thread-native workflow** — each tab runs an independent Codex thread you can resume later.
- **Local-first** — everything runs through your local Codex CLI. No telemetry, no cloud dependency.

## How It Works

```
UI prompt → Main process routes to Codex app-server → event stream → live render
                                         → tool call? → permission UI → approve/deny
```

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full deep-dive.

## Install App (Recommended)

The fastest way to get CLUI running as a regular Mac app. This installs dependencies, voice support (Whisper), builds the app, copies it to `/Applications`, and launches it.

**1) Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justjxke/clui.git
```

**2) Double-click `install-app.command`**

Open the `clui` folder in Finder and double-click `install-app.command`.

> **First launch:** macOS may block the app because it's unsigned. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**. You only need to do this once.
> **Folder cleanup:** the installer removes temporary `dist/` and `release/` folders after a successful install to keep the repo tidy.

After the initial install, just open **CLUI** from your Applications folder or Spotlight.

<summary><strong>Terminal / Developer Commands</strong></summary>

Only `install-app.command` is kept at root intentionally for non-technical users. Developer scripts live in `commands/`.

### Quick Start (Terminal)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justjxke/clui.git
```

```bash
cd clui
```

```bash
./commands/setup.command
```

```bash
./commands/start.command
```

> Press **⌥ + Space** to show/hide the overlay. If your macOS input source claims that combo, use **Cmd+Shift+K**, or set a custom keybind in the ... menu.

To stop:

```bash
./commands/stop.command
```

### Developer Workflow

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Renderer changes update instantly. Main-process changes require restarting `npm run dev`.

### Other Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `./commands/setup.command` | Environment check + install dependencies |
| `./commands/start.command` | Build and launch from source |
| `./commands/stop.command` | Stop all CLUI processes |
| `npm run build` | Production build (no packaging) |
| `npm run dist` | Package as macOS `.app` into `release/` |
| `npm run doctor` | Run environment diagnostic |

<summary><strong>Setup Prerequisites (Detailed)</strong></summary>

You need **macOS 13+**. Then install these one at a time — copy each command and paste it into Terminal.

**Step 1.** Install Xcode Command Line Tools (needed to compile native modules):

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Step 2.** Install Node.js (recommended: current LTS such as 20 or 22; minimum supported: 18). Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), or use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

Verify it's on your PATH:

```bash
node --version
```

**Step 3.** Make sure Python has `setuptools` (needed by the native module compiler). On Python 3.12+ this is missing by default:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

**Step 4.** Install Codex:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

**Step 5.** Authenticate Codex (follow the prompts that appear):

```bash
codex
```

**Step 6.** Install Whisper for voice input:

```bash
# Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) — preferred:
brew install whisperkit-cli
# Apple Silicon fallback, or Intel Mac:
brew install whisper-cpp
```

> **No API keys or `.env` file required.** CLUI uses your existing Codex authentication.

```

### How It Works

1. Each tab opens a Codex session through the local app-server.
2. Event messages are parsed by `CodexAppServerClient` and normalized by `CodexEventNormalizer`.
3. `ControlPlane` manages tab lifecycle (connecting → idle → running → completed/failed/dead).
4. Tool permission requests arrive via HTTP hooks to `PermissionServer` (localhost only).
5. The renderer polls backend health every 1.5s and reconciles tab state.
6. Sessions are resumed with `--resume <session-id>` for continuity.

### Network Behavior

CLUI operates almost entirely offline. The only outbound network calls are:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Required |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/*` | Marketplace catalog (cached 5 min) | No — graceful fallback |
| `api.github.com/repos/anthropics/*/tarball/*` | Skill auto-install on startup | No — skipped on failure |

No telemetry, analytics, or auto-update mechanisms. All core Codex interaction goes through the local CLI.

## Troubleshooting

For setup issues and recovery commands, see [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

Quick self-check:

```bash
npm run doctor
```

## Tested On

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| macOS | 15.x (Sequoia) |
| Node.js | 20.x LTS, 22.x |
| Python | 3.12 (with setuptools installed) |
| Electron | 33.x |

## Known Limitations

- **macOS only** — transparent overlay, tray icon, and node-pty are macOS-specific. Windows/Linux support is not currently implemented.
- **Requires Codex** — CLUI is a UI layer, not a standalone AI client. You need an authenticated `codex` installation.
- **Permission mode** — uses `--permission-mode default`. The PTY interactive transport is legacy and disabled by default.
